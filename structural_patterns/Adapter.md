Adapter Design Pattern in Java:
The Adapter Pattern allows you to make two incompatible classes work together. This pattern is incredibly useful when you have existing code you want to use with a new system or when you need to integrate third-party libraries.

Here's a breakdown of the pattern:

Core Concepts:

Target: This interface defines the methods that the client code expects.
Adaptee: This is the class you want to adapt, which doesn't directly implement the Target interface.
Adapter: This class implements the Target interface and adapts the Adaptee's functionality to the Target's interface.
Example Scenario:

Let's imagine you have an existing legacy database (Adaptee) that uses a function called getRecordByCode(). You also have a new API (Target) that requires a method getDataByUniqueID(). The Adapter pattern can bridge the gap:

// Target interface
public interface DatabaseAPI {
    String getDataByUniqueID(String id);
}

// Adaptee class
public class LegacyDatabase {
    public String getRecordByCode(int code) {
        // Implement retrieval logic from legacy database
        return "Data from legacy database";
    }
}

// Adapter class
public class DatabaseAdapter implements DatabaseAPI {
    private LegacyDatabase legacyDatabase;

    public DatabaseAdapter(LegacyDatabase legacyDatabase) {
        this.legacyDatabase = legacyDatabase;
    }

    @Override
    public String getDataByUniqueID(String id) {
        // Convert the uniqueID to legacy code (assuming a mapping exists)
        int code = Integer.parseInt(id); // Example, use appropriate mapping
        return legacyDatabase.getRecordByCode(code);
    }
}

// Client code
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LegacyDatabase legacyDB = new LegacyDatabase();
        DatabaseAdapter adapter = new DatabaseAdapter(legacyDB);
        String data = adapter.getDataByUniqueID("1234"); 
        System.out.println(data); // Prints "Data from legacy database"
    }
}
Explanation:

The DatabaseAPI interface defines the expected method getDataByUniqueID().
The LegacyDatabase class has the incompatible method getRecordByCode().
The DatabaseAdapter class acts as a bridge, implementing DatabaseAPI and using getRecordByCode() from LegacyDatabase internally, making the necessary conversions.
The Main class interacts with the adapter using the getDataByUniqueID() method, unaware of the underlying legacy database.
Benefits:

Reusability: Allows you to reuse existing code without modifying it directly.
Loose Coupling: Decouples the client code from the Adaptee.
Maintainability: Easier to change Adaptee implementations without impacting client code.
Flexibility: Allows for different adaptations to the same Adaptee for various Target interfaces.
Variations:

Class Adapter: Implements the Target interface directly within the Adapter class (as shown in the example).
Object Adapter: Uses a composition of the Adaptee inside the Adapter and delegates the Adaptee's functionality through delegation.
The Adapter design pattern is a versatile solution for integrating existing code with new systems or when dealing with different interfaces. It enhances reusability, maintainability, and flexibility in your codebase.
