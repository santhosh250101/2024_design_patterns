Decorating Your Code: Understanding the Decorator Design Pattern in Java
The Decorator design pattern is a powerful and flexible way to add additional responsibilities or behaviors to an existing object dynamically, without altering its original structure. Think of it as adding layers of decorations to a base object, much like you might decorate a Christmas tree with ornaments.

When to Use the Decorator Pattern:

You want to avoid modifying the core functionality of an object but need to extend its behavior.
You need to provide various optional behaviors for an object, and those behaviors can be combined.
You need to implement these behaviors dynamically, at runtime.
Let's Illustrate with Java:

Imagine you're building a coffee shop system. You have a basic Coffee class:

public class Coffee {
    private String description;

    public Coffee(String description) {
        this.description = description;
    }

    public String getDescription() {
        return description;
    }

    public double cost() {
        return 1.00; // Basic coffee cost
    }
}
Now, you want to add decorators for different coffee variations:

Milk Decorator: Adds milk to the coffee, increasing its cost.

public class MilkDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {
    public MilkDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
        super(coffee);
    }

    @Override
    public String getDescription() {
        return coffee.getDescription() + ", Milk";
    }

    @Override
    public double cost() {
        return coffee.cost() + 0.50; // Cost of adding milk
    }
}
Sugar Decorator: Adds sugar to the coffee, again increasing the cost.

public class SugarDecorator extends CoffeeDecorator {
    public SugarDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
        super(coffee);
    }

    @Override
    public String getDescription() {
        return coffee.getDescription() + ", Sugar";
    }

    @Override
    public double cost() {
        return coffee.cost() + 0.25; // Cost of adding sugar
    }
}
Coffee Decorator: This abstract class provides a base for other decorators, ensuring all decorators follow a similar structure.

public abstract class CoffeeDecorator extends Coffee {
    protected Coffee coffee;

    public CoffeeDecorator(Coffee coffee) {
        this.coffee = coffee;
    }

    @Override
    public abstract String getDescription();

    @Override
    public abstract double cost();
}
Now, we can combine decorators to create complex orders:

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Coffee blackCoffee = new Coffee("Black Coffee");
        System.out.println(blackCoffee.getDescription() + " - $" + blackCoffee.cost());

        Coffee latte = new MilkDecorator(new Coffee("Espresso"));
        System.out.println(latte.getDescription() + " - $" + latte.cost());

        Coffee caramelMacchiato = new SugarDecorator(new MilkDecorator(new Coffee("Espresso")));
        System.out.println(caramelMacchiato.getDescription() + " - $" + caramelMacchiato.cost());
    }
}
Output:

Black Coffee - $1.0
Espresso, Milk - $1.5
Espresso, Milk, Sugar - $2.0
Benefits of the Decorator Pattern:

Extensibility: Easily add new decorations without modifying existing code.
Flexibility: Combine decorations in any order and quantity, achieving a wide range of functionalities.
Open/Closed Principle: The original Coffee class remains closed for modification, but open for extension through decorators.
Readability: The code becomes cleaner and more understandable by encapsulating specific functionalities in decorators.
The Decorator pattern allows us to wrap our original Coffee object with layers of embellishments, providing an elegant and modular approach to customizing objects dynamically. This approach ensures reusability, extensibility, and clarity in your Java applications.
