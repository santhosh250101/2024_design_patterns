Chain of Responsibility: Decoupling Handlers for Flexible Request Routing
The Chain of Responsibility pattern offers a flexible way to handle requests by creating a chain of handlers, each capable of processing the request. Each handler can choose to process the request itself, pass it along to the next handler, or do both.

Key Features:

Decoupled Handlers: Handlers are independent, unaware of the others in the chain. This fosters flexibility and maintainability.
Flexible Routing: Requests can be handled by different handlers depending on the specifics of the request.
Enhanced Testability: Handlers can be tested in isolation.
When to Use:

When you need to handle a request in various ways based on conditions.
When you need to avoid coupling the sender of a request to its handler.
When you want to make it easy to add or remove new handlers without affecting others.
Example Scenario:

Let's consider an order processing system with different stages like:

Order Validation: Ensuring valid customer details and product availability.
Inventory Check: Verifying stock quantities.
Payment Processing: Accepting payments via different gateways.
Shipping: Preparing the order for delivery.
Implementation:

// Abstract Handler Interface
interface Handler {
    void handleRequest(Request request);
}

// Concrete Handler: Order Validation
class OrderValidationHandler implements Handler {
    @Override
    public void handleRequest(Request request) {
        if (request.isValidOrder()) {
            System.out.println("Order validation successful.");
            nextHandler.handleRequest(request); // Pass to next handler
        } else {
            System.out.println("Order validation failed.");
        }
    }

    private Handler nextHandler; // Reference to next handler

    public OrderValidationHandler(Handler nextHandler) {
        this.nextHandler = nextHandler;
    }
}

// Concrete Handler: Inventory Check
class InventoryCheckHandler implements Handler {
    @Override
    public void handleRequest(Request request) {
        if (request.hasEnoughStock()) {
            System.out.println("Inventory check successful.");
            nextHandler.handleRequest(request);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Inventory check failed.");
        }
    }

    private Handler nextHandler; // Reference to next handler

    public InventoryCheckHandler(Handler nextHandler) {
        this.nextHandler = nextHandler;
    }
}

// ... (Other Handlers: Payment Processing, Shipping)

// Request Object
class Request {
    // ... attributes: order details, payment information, etc.

    // Validation Methods
    boolean isValidOrder() {
        // ... logic
    }
    
    boolean hasEnoughStock() {
        // ... logic
    }
}

public class ChainOfResponsibilityExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create chain of handlers
        Handler shippingHandler = new ShippingHandler(null); // No next handler
        Handler paymentHandler = new PaymentHandler(shippingHandler);
        Handler inventoryHandler = new InventoryCheckHandler(paymentHandler);
        Handler validationHandler = new OrderValidationHandler(inventoryHandler);

        // Process request
        Request request = new Request(); // ... (initialize request with order data)
        validationHandler.handleRequest(request); 
    }
}
Benefits of the Pattern:

Extensibility: New handlers can be added easily without affecting existing ones.
Reusability: Handlers can be reused in different chains.
Flexibility: The order of handlers in the chain can be changed easily, altering the processing flow.
Simplified Handling: The sender of the request doesn't need to know the complete handling logic.

Chain of Responsibility: A Design Pattern for Flexible Request Handling

Imagine you're building an e-commerce website. When a user places an order, your system needs to handle several steps: validating the order details, checking if there's enough stock, processing the payment, and finally shipping the order. The Chain of Responsibility pattern comes in handy here.

How it Works:

The Chain of Responsibility creates a chain of handlers. Each handler is responsible for a specific task (e.g., validating the order). When a request arrives, the first handler in the chain takes a look at it. If it's able to handle the request, it does so and then potentially passes it along to the next handler in the chain. If the handler can't handle it, it might simply pass it along.

Benefits:

Simplified Code: Instead of one giant handler, the logic is broken into smaller, focused modules.
Flexibility: Adding or removing handlers in the chain becomes easy, allowing for future extensions.
Reusability: Handlers can be reused across different processing chains, reducing duplication.
Example Code:

Conclusion:

The Chain of Responsibility pattern offers a powerful and flexible approach to request handling. Its ability to decouple handlers and provide dynamic routing makes it ideal for applications where the handling process is complex and may evolve over time.
