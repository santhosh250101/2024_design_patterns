The Observer Design Pattern: A Comprehensive Guide with Java Examples
The Observer pattern is a fundamental behavioral design pattern in object-oriented programming. It defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, ensuring that whenever the state of one object (the "subject") changes, all its dependent objects (the "observers") are notified and updated.

Imagine this scenario:

You're subscribed to a news website, and you want to receive email alerts whenever there's a breaking news story. You wouldn't manually check the website every few minutes, right? Instead, you subscribe to their service and get notifications automatically.

This is precisely what the Observer pattern accomplishes in software.

Let's break down the Observer pattern with Java examples:

1. Subject (or Observable):

Defines methods for attaching and detaching observers.
Notifies observers about state changes.
interface Subject {
  void attach(Observer observer);
  void detach(Observer observer);
  void notifyObservers();
}
2. Observer:

Defines an update method that is called by the subject to inform observers of a change.
interface Observer {
  void update(Subject subject);
}
Example 1: Weather Station with Temperature Updates:

Subject (WeatherStation):

public class WeatherStation implements Subject {
  private int temperature;
  private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();

  public WeatherStation(int temperature) {
    this.temperature = temperature;
  }

  @Override
  public void attach(Observer observer) {
    observers.add(observer);
  }

  @Override
  public void detach(Observer observer) {
    observers.remove(observer);
  }

  @Override
  public void notifyObservers() {
    for (Observer observer : observers) {
      observer.update(this);
    }
  }

  public void setTemperature(int temperature) {
    this.temperature = temperature;
    notifyObservers();
  }

  public int getTemperature() {
    return temperature;
  }
}
Observer (TemperatureDisplay):

public class TemperatureDisplay implements Observer {
  @Override
  public void update(Subject subject) {
    if (subject instanceof WeatherStation) {
      WeatherStation weatherStation = (WeatherStation) subject;
      System.out.println("Current Temperature: " + weatherStation.getTemperature());
    }
  }
}
Usage:

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    WeatherStation weatherStation = new WeatherStation(25);

    TemperatureDisplay temperatureDisplay = new TemperatureDisplay();

    weatherStation.attach(temperatureDisplay); // Subscribe to updates

    weatherStation.setTemperature(30); // Triggers notification
    // Output: Current Temperature: 30

    weatherStation.setTemperature(20); // Another notification
    // Output: Current Temperature: 20

    weatherStation.detach(temperatureDisplay); // Unsubscribe
  }
}
Example 2: Online Shop with Stock Notifications:

Subject (Shop):

public class Shop implements Subject {
  private int productStock;
  private List<Observer> observers = new ArrayList<>();

  public Shop(int productStock) {
    this.productStock = productStock;
  }

  @Override
  public void attach(Observer observer) {
    observers.add(observer);
  }

  @Override
  public void detach(Observer observer) {
    observers.remove(observer);
  }

  @Override
  public void notifyObservers() {
    for (Observer observer : observers) {
      observer.update(this);
    }
  }

  public void setProductStock(int productStock) {
    this.productStock = productStock;
    notifyObservers();
  }

  public int getProductStock() {
    return productStock;
  }
}
Observer (StockNotifier):

public class StockNotifier implements Observer {
  @Override
  public void update(Subject subject) {
    if (subject instanceof Shop) {
      Shop shop = (Shop) subject;
      System.out.println("Stock updated! Available products: " + shop.getProductStock());
    }
  }
}
Usage:

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Shop shop = new Shop(10);

    StockNotifier stockNotifier = new StockNotifier();

    shop.attach(stockNotifier); 

    shop.setProductStock(5); // Triggers notification
    // Output: Stock updated! Available products: 5

    shop.setProductStock(0); // Another notification
    // Output: Stock updated! Available products: 0
  }
}
Key Benefits of Observer Pattern:

Loose Coupling: Subject and Observer objects are independent, allowing you to modify one without affecting the other.
Flexibility: You can easily add or remove observers without modifying the subject.
Extensibility: You can add different observer types without affecting existing code.
Consider these aspects:

The Observer pattern is well-suited for situations where there's a dynamic relationship between objects that needs to be managed.
The "notify" operation of the subject can be optimized for efficiency, particularly when there are many observers.
Conclusion:

The Observer pattern empowers your Java applications with a flexible, maintainable, and efficient way to manage object relationships, enabling clear communication and reactivity in complex scenarios.
