The Strategy Design Pattern: Mastering Algorithm Flexibility in Java
The Strategy pattern is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. Imagine you're building a shopping cart system that offers different shipping options (Standard, Express, Overnight). Each option has its own logic for calculating the delivery cost and time. Using Strategy, you can encapsulate each shipping method as a separate strategy, making it easy to switch between them and even add new options later.

The Key Components:
Strategy Interface: Defines the common interface for all strategies. This interface should contain methods that all algorithms will implement.
Concrete Strategies: Concrete implementations of the Strategy interface, each implementing a specific algorithm.
Context: Holds a reference to a strategy object and delegates the execution of the algorithm to it.
Example: Shopping Cart with Different Shipping Options
Let's say our shopping cart system offers three shipping options: Standard, Express, and Overnight. We'll use Strategy to encapsulate the logic for calculating shipping costs.

// 1. Strategy Interface
interface ShippingStrategy {
    double calculateShippingCost(double cartTotal);
}

// 2. Concrete Strategies
class StandardShipping implements ShippingStrategy {
    @Override
    public double calculateShippingCost(double cartTotal) {
        return 5.00;  // Flat rate for standard shipping
    }
}

class ExpressShipping implements ShippingStrategy {
    @Override
    public double calculateShippingCost(double cartTotal) {
        return 10.00 + cartTotal * 0.05; // 5% of cart total + base fee
    }
}

class OvernightShipping implements ShippingStrategy {
    @Override
    public double calculateShippingCost(double cartTotal) {
        return 20.00 + cartTotal * 0.10; // 10% of cart total + base fee
    }
}

// 3. Context
class ShoppingCart {
    private ShippingStrategy shippingStrategy;

    public ShoppingCart(ShippingStrategy shippingStrategy) {
        this.shippingStrategy = shippingStrategy;
    }

    public double calculateTotal(double cartTotal) {
        return cartTotal + shippingStrategy.calculateShippingCost(cartTotal);
    }
}
Usage Example:
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a shopping cart with Standard shipping
        ShoppingCart cart = new ShoppingCart(new StandardShipping());
        double cartTotal = 100.00;
        System.out.println("Total with Standard Shipping: " + cart.calculateTotal(cartTotal));

        // Change shipping strategy to Express
        cart.shippingStrategy = new ExpressShipping();
        System.out.println("Total with Express Shipping: " + cart.calculateTotal(cartTotal));
    }
}
Advantages of Strategy Pattern:
Flexibility: Easily switch between algorithms by changing the strategy object.
Open-Closed Principle: New algorithms can be added without modifying existing code.
Reduced Complexity: Encapsulates complex algorithms, making the main code cleaner and easier to understand.
When to use the Strategy Pattern:
You need to perform different algorithms for a specific task.
You need to be able to switch between these algorithms easily.
You want to keep the main code clean and modular.
Conclusion:
The Strategy pattern is a versatile design pattern that provides a powerful way to define and manage different algorithms in your Java code. By encapsulating algorithms and making them interchangeable, Strategy enhances flexibility and maintainability, making your code easier to adapt to changing requirements.
