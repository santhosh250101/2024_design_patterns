Builder Design Pattern in Java
The Builder design pattern is used to construct complex objects step-by-step. It separates the construction logic from the object's representation, promoting code reusability, readability, and flexibility.

Core Components:

Product: The complex object being constructed.
Builder: Defines an abstract interface for creating parts of the Product.
ConcreteBuilder: Concrete implementations of the Builder interface, each responsible for constructing specific variations of the Product.
Director: Orchestrates the construction process, using different ConcreteBuilders to create variations of the Product.
Example: Building a Pizza

Let's imagine we're building a Pizza using the Builder pattern:

1. Product:

public class Pizza {
    private String dough;
    private String sauce;
    private String[] toppings;

    // Constructors and getters...
}
2. Builder:

public interface PizzaBuilder {
    void setDough(String dough);
    void setSauce(String sauce);
    void addTopping(String topping);
    Pizza build(); 
}
3. ConcreteBuilders:

public class MargheritaPizzaBuilder implements PizzaBuilder {
    private Pizza pizza = new Pizza();

    @Override
    public void setDough(String dough) {
        pizza.setDough(dough);
    }

    @Override
    public void setSauce(String sauce) {
        pizza.setSauce(sauce);
    }

    @Override
    public void addTopping(String topping) {
        pizza.addTopping(topping);
    }

    @Override
    public Pizza build() {
        return pizza;
    }
}

// Similarly, we can have other concrete builders for different pizza types:
public class PepperoniPizzaBuilder implements PizzaBuilder { 
    // ...
}
4. Director:

public class PizzaChef {
    public Pizza createPizza(PizzaBuilder builder) {
        builder.setDough("Thin crust");
        builder.setSauce("Tomato");
        builder.addTopping("Cheese");
        // Additional toppings or customizations...
        return builder.build();
    }
}
Usage:

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PizzaChef chef = new PizzaChef();

        // Create a Margherita Pizza
        PizzaBuilder margheritaBuilder = new MargheritaPizzaBuilder();
        Pizza margherita = chef.createPizza(margheritaBuilder); 
        System.out.println("Margherita: " + margherita);

        // Create a Pepperoni Pizza
        PizzaBuilder pepperoniBuilder = new PepperoniPizzaBuilder();
        Pizza pepperoni = chef.createPizza(pepperoniBuilder);
        System.out.println("Pepperoni: " + pepperoni);
    }
}
Benefits:

Flexibility: Easily create different Pizza variations using different ConcreteBuilders.
Code Reusability: The Director class handles the common construction steps, eliminating repeated code.
Readability: Construction logic is encapsulated within Builders, improving code organization.
Immutability: You can achieve immutable Pizza objects if the setters are private and accessed only through Builders.
Remember: This is a simplified example. The Builder pattern can handle even more complex objects with numerous steps and variations.
