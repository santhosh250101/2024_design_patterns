Abstract Factory Design Pattern in Java
The Abstract Factory pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.

Imagine you're creating a website for a furniture store. You need different types of furniture (chairs, tables, beds) but each needs to have a specific style, like "modern" or "vintage".

Here's how Abstract Factory can help:

1. Abstract Factory:

Defines an interface for creating objects, each of which corresponds to a concrete product.
interface FurnitureFactory {
    Chair createChair();
    Table createTable();
    Bed createBed();
}
2. Concrete Factories:

Implement the Abstract Factory interface and define concrete products for a specific style.
class ModernFurnitureFactory implements FurnitureFactory {
    @Override
    public Chair createChair() { return new ModernChair(); }
    @Override
    public Table createTable() { return new ModernTable(); }
    @Override
    public Bed createBed() { return new ModernBed(); }
}

class VintageFurnitureFactory implements FurnitureFactory {
    @Override
    public Chair createChair() { return new VintageChair(); }
    @Override
    public Table createTable() { return new VintageTable(); }
    @Override
    public Bed createBed() { return new VintageBed(); }
}
3. Concrete Products:

Define the actual implementation of each furniture type.
class ModernChair implements Chair { /* ... */ }
class ModernTable implements Table { /* ... */ }
class ModernBed implements Bed { /* ... */ }
// Similar implementations for VintageChair, VintageTable, VintageBed
4. Client Code:

Uses the Abstract Factory to create different families of objects based on the desired style.
class Website {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FurnitureFactory modernFactory = new ModernFurnitureFactory();
        Chair modernChair = modernFactory.createChair();
        Table modernTable = modernFactory.createTable();
        // ... create other furniture in modern style

        FurnitureFactory vintageFactory = new VintageFurnitureFactory();
        Chair vintageChair = vintageFactory.createChair();
        Table vintageTable = vintageFactory.createTable();
        // ... create other furniture in vintage style
    }
}
#Benefits of Abstract Factory:

Decouples client code from concrete product classes: Clients work with the Abstract Factory, making them independent of the specific concrete implementations.
Easy to switch between families of related objects: You can simply change the factory being used to switch the entire set of related objects.
Promotes consistency and adherence to the desired style.
Example Scenario:

Imagine you want to design the modern and vintage versions of a living room, each requiring different types of furniture. Abstract Factory makes it easy:

Create Modern Furniture:

FurnitureFactory modernFactory = new ModernFurnitureFactory();
Chair modernChair = modernFactory.createChair(); 
Sofa modernSofa = modernFactory.createSofa();
Table modernTable = modernFactory.createTable(); 
// ...  
Create Vintage Furniture:

FurnitureFactory vintageFactory = new VintageFurnitureFactory();
Chair vintageChair = vintageFactory.createChair();
Sofa vintageSofa = vintageFactory.createSofa();
Table vintageTable = vintageFactory.createTable();
// ... 
You can easily change the factory being used to create a different style of living room.

Note: Abstract Factory is best used when dealing with families of related objects where a specific theme or configuration needs to be maintained. It ensures that the objects created within a family share common characteristics, making it suitable for complex scenarios where consistent styles or behaviors are required.
