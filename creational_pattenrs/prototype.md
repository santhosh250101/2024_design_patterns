Prototype Design Pattern in Java
The Prototype design pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to create new objects by copying existing objects. This is useful when:

Creating new objects is expensive. The copying mechanism is usually faster than constructing a new object from scratch.
The object's class structure is complex. This can make construction using constructors difficult and time-consuming.
You want to avoid using subclassing. The Prototype pattern allows you to easily create variations of an object without defining new subclasses.
Here's a breakdown of the pattern and a Java example:

1. The Prototype Interface:

public interface Prototype {
  Prototype clone();
}
This interface defines a clone() method that every prototype class must implement. This method creates a copy of the object.

2. The Concrete Prototype Classes:

public class Shape implements Prototype {
  private String type;

  public Shape(String type) {
    this.type = type;
  }

  @Override
  public Shape clone() {
    Shape clone = new Shape(this.type);
    return clone;
  }

  public String getType() {
    return this.type;
  }
}

public class Circle extends Shape {
  public Circle(String type) {
    super(type);
  }

  // Deep copy with additional properties
  @Override
  public Circle clone() {
    Circle clone = new Circle(this.type);
    // ... copy additional properties
    return clone;
  }
}
Concrete Prototype classes implement the clone() method, which can be a simple shallow copy or a deep copy (depending on the needs).

3. The Prototype Manager (Optional):

import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class PrototypeManager {
  private Map<String, Prototype> prototypes = new HashMap<>();

  public void registerPrototype(String key, Prototype prototype) {
    prototypes.put(key, prototype);
  }

  public Prototype getPrototype(String key) {
    return prototypes.get(key).clone();
  }
}
The manager holds a collection of prototype objects. It allows you to retrieve and clone prototypes by their key.

Example Usage:

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    PrototypeManager manager = new PrototypeManager();
    Shape shape1 = new Shape("Square");
    Circle circle1 = new Circle("Circle");

    manager.registerPrototype("Square", shape1);
    manager.registerPrototype("Circle", circle1);

    Shape shape2 = (Shape) manager.getPrototype("Square");
    Circle circle2 = (Circle) manager.getPrototype("Circle");

    System.out.println("shape1 type: " + shape1.getType() + ", shape2 type: " + shape2.getType()); 
    // Output: shape1 type: Square, shape2 type: Square
    // (Note: shape2 is a clone of shape1)

    // Same logic for the Circle object
  }
}
In this example, the PrototypeManager allows us to clone and reuse Shape and Circle objects, which could be complex objects with multiple properties.

Advantages of Prototype Pattern:

Flexibility: It allows you to add new prototypes dynamically.
Reduced code complexity: It avoids subclassing and makes it easy to create variations of an object.
Improved performance: Cloning can be more efficient than constructing new objects, especially for complex objects.
Disadvantages of Prototype Pattern:

Complex implementation: The clone() method might be complex for deeply nested objects.
Difficult to maintain: Can be complex to understand and maintain for larger projects.
Remember to choose the right design pattern based on your specific needs and context. Consider carefully whether the benefits outweigh the potential complexity of the implementation.
